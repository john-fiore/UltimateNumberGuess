Ultimate Number Guess
official source code repo

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Ultimate Number Guess is a simple console
based number guessing game written in
Python. It is written by me, a HS Junior,
for my programming class.

The goal was to make a program that used
at least one While loop and at least one
nested loop OR loop control statement.

WHY THIS CODE MIGHT SUCK:

If you're a programmer looking at this code,
you might have noticed I used string concatenation
rather than f-strings. Why, you ask? The reason is
simple: the school's IDE SUCKS.

Our class uses TechSmart for coding and learning how
to code. While TechSmart is generally good, the issue
is I firmly believe that they haven't updated Python
past 3.6, because f-strings did NOT work. So I had no
choice but to use string concatenation. I don't hate it,
but it might be viewed as "outdated" by modern programming
standards.
